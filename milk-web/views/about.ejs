                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: justify;">Dairy farming will never be profitable if you are not
                    producing enough milk. On
                    average, a dairy cow produces 6-7 gallons of milk in a day. Certain breeds produce between 6,800kg
                    and 17000kg per year. The udder milk produced will vary from one breed to another and other factors
                    may also come to play.
                    <br>
                    Normally, the milk levels will peak around 40-60 days after calving. It then declines steadily until
                    when milking stops after 10 months. The dairy cow is then dried off sixty days to the expected
                    calving date. This gives the farmer a 12-14 months productive inter calving cycle of which 10 are
                    milking months.

        <div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
            <p class="card-text">The volume of milk sold is quite vital in determining whether you are making a profit
                or loss. It is the volume that will determine whether you can maximize your revenues. An increase in
                production goes a long way in diluting the burden of fixed costs. It makes the farming self reliant and
                the farmer enjoys a profit.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 mt-5">
                <p class="card-text">The amount of milk produced per kilo of dry matter intake gives a reflection of a
                    cowâ€™s profitability. Feeds are quite costly and the dairy cow needs to produce milk proportional to
                    feeds intake. A farmer pegs their expectation on milk production and will only be motivated to
                    improve the diet proportions if the milk produced meets requirements.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary">Increasing Dairy Profitability: Milk preservation</h3>

            <div class="col-md-6 mt-5">
                <p class="card-text p_card">Milk production fluctuates with different seasons. Every year, farmers
                    complain of
                    milk influx, especially between May and July. At such times, milk prices drop to rock bottom. It is
                    at such times that farmers incur huge losses. These losses end up eating into previous months
                    profits.
                    <br><br>
                    Much as you may stagger breeding times, large scale milk production will always tend to be a
                    challenge. Milk is a major ingredient in most recipes. It adds flavor and loads of nutrients. But
                    how do you preserve your milk to guarantee its presence in your recipes?

                    <br><br>
                    Well, milk preservation dates back decades ago when windmills were in use before the arrival of
                    refrigeration. The secret behind milk preservation is low temperatures as this inhibits the activity
                    of
                    bacteria that turn the milk bad.

            <p class="card-text p_card mt-2">The Smarttag Neck measures the time and moments a cow spends eating,
                ruminating,
                being inactive and showing other active behavior. The Smarttag Leg does the same for standing, lying and
                walking behavior and also measures the amount of steps and standups.
                <br><br>
                The system compares this behavior with standards for optimum condition, the previous behavior of the cow
                and the behavior of the group she is in. It turns this information into relevant alerts, to-do lists and
                reports so you and your team can proactively manage the health of each cow and the entire herd.

                    Early detection of these abnormalities in combination with quick action helps minimize the emergence
                    of health issues, and thus prevents the possible need for medical treatment, a drop in milk

                    because of changes in the environment, feed, energy balance and stress. A change in behavior may
